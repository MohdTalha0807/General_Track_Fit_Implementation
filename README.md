# General_Track_Fit_Implementation

# Overview
Implementation of the General Track Fit based on Triplets:
• This research assistantship was aimed at the complete implementation and the testing of the General Track Fit for three barrel layers of the ATLAS Event Filter.
• Different fitting algorithms for the cases of dominating multiple scattering and hit uncertainties were implemented with promising results.
